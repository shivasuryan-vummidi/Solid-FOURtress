5. create subclass User that has implementations of drop_token() and is_win()
6. modify driver class Woo to create instances of User.
7. modify driver class Woo to call on each instance of drop_token() and is_win()
8. modify driver class Woo to import java.util.* and java.io.* to then create an InputStreamReader and a BufferedReader.
