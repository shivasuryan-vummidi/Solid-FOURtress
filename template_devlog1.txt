Actions taken so far:
1. We are able to make Woo.java compile, which is a good sign
2. We made all the classes more modular and compatible with each other, where we often call one method in Woo, which calls a corresponding method in User, and then calls another method in Woo. 
3. We added the drop function to make pieces drop into the board.
